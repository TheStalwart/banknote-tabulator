[The shop](https://veikals.banknote.lv/c/datortehnika/portativie-datori) 
often has good deals in stock 
but doesn't allow filtering laptops by RAM,
among other UI/UX mortal sins.

I'm hosting an instance 
at [banknote.retromultiplayer.com](https://banknote.retromultiplayer.com/)
but index is not being regularly updated for technical reasons.
